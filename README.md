# JobRequestSaver
Simple page to store your job requests.

The information about requests is stored in memory. That means, that when you close the app the information will be deleted.
You can change the place where information is stored. For example you can store data in MS Sql Server and ect.

This is the studying app. I am trying to use my knowledge to solve simple problem. I need to store info about my trying to get my first job as junior developer. This page is the solution to this problem. I'll refactor this app and improve functionality as I'll learn something new and improve my code skills.
